### Creative Code Jam project

[With a web page too!](http://hamoid.github.io/robogarden) (First attempt at gh-pages)

With robots, and gardening.

- robotTest/ includes just one robot, and moves only when pressing the space bar.
- botsBehaviour/ includes autonomous planter and cutter robots.

To implement:
- Robots should leave two tracks, one per wheel.
- Wheels should be chains, as in a tank.
- Plants should grow up in 3D, maybe flat spirals.
- When cut, plants should fall down on the ground and change color.
- Planter robot could shoot seed up in the air. Then it lands and starts growing.
- Emoticons should not be random, but represent robot state.
- Add sounds.
