Creative Code Jam project

With robots, and gardening.

robotTest/ includes just one robot, and moves only when pressing the space bar.

botsBehaviour/ includes autonomous planter and cutter robots.

To implement:
- Wheels should be chains, as in a tank.
- Plants should grow up in 3D, maybe flat spirals.
- When cut, plants should fall down on the ground and change color.
- Planter robot could shoot seed up in the air. Then it lands and starts growing.
- Add sounds.
- ~~Robots should leave two tracks, one per wheel.~~
- ~~Emoticons should not be random, but represent robot state.~~
- ~~Tracks slowly fade away.~~
